# RISC-V 5-Stage Pipelined Processor

This project implements a 32-bit RISC-V processor with a 5-stage pipeline architecture using Verilog HDL. The design follows the RV32I instruction set and includes hazard detection and forwarding mechanisms.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
3. **Execution (EX)**
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
5. **Write Back (WB)**

## Features

- Supports RV32I instruction set
- Implements data forwarding and hazard detection
- Modular design for clarity and scalability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado)
